# HollywoodSaver

A native macOS menu bar app that turns your Mac into a video screensaver machine. Play looping videos and GIFs fullscreen — on your built-in display, external monitor, or both. Built with Swift in a single file, no Xcode project needed.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Screensaver Mode** | Fullscreen video, cursor hidden, dismiss with Escape/click/mouse |
| **Ambient Mode** | Play on external monitor while you keep working on your Mac |
| **Multi-Screen** | Built-in, external, all screens — your choice |
| **Video + GIF** | Supports `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, and `.gif` files |
| **Volume Slider** | Adjustable volume with mute toggle |
| **Opacity Slider** | Fade the video in ambient mode to see your desktop through it |
| **Loop** | Toggle looping on/off — play forever or just once |
| **Shuffle** | Pick a random video from your collection |
| **Auto Play** | Automatically start playing when the app launches |
| **Launch at Login** | Start the app every time you log in |
| **Custom Icon** | Drop a `ranger.png` next to the app for a custom menu bar icon |
| **Portable** | Move the whole folder anywhere — the app finds its videos |

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 15+ (Apple Silicon — M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidtkeane/HollywoodSaver.git
cd HollywoodSaver
bash build.sh
open HollywoodSaver.app
```

### Add Videos

Download the included `hollywood.mp4` from the [Releases](https://github.com/davidtkeane/HollywoodSaver/releases) page, or add your own videos:

1. Drop any `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, or `.gif` files into the `HollywoodSaver` folder (next to the `.app`)
2. Click the menu bar icon — your videos appear automatically
3. That's it

### Free Screensaver Videos

Looking for cool videos to use? Here are some great free sources:

- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/search/screensaver/) — 700+ free 4K clips
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/loop/) — Curated free loop videos

## How It Works

Click the helmet icon (or play icon) in your menu bar to see all your videos listed. Each video gives you options:

**Screensaver** — goes fullscreen and blocks everything like a real screensaver. Escape, click, or move the mouse to dismiss.

**Ambient (keep working)** — plays on your external monitor while your Mac stays usable. Toggle it off from the menu bar whenever you want.

### Settings

All settings are in the dropdown menu and persist between restarts:

- **Sound** — toggle audio on/off
- **Volume** — drag the slider
- **Opacity** — transparency for ambient mode
- **Loop** — repeat forever or play once
- **Auto Play on Launch** — resume the last video automatically
- **Launch at Login** — start with macOS

## Sharing to Other Macs

Send the entire `HollywoodSaver` folder (app + videos) to another Mac. On the receiving Mac, remove the quarantine flag first:

```bash
xattr -cr ~/Desktop/HollywoodSaver
```

Then just open the app. Works on any Apple Silicon Mac (M1-M4) running macOS 15+.

## Project Structure

```
HollywoodSaver/
  HollywoodSaver.swift    # All app logic (~800 lines)
  build.sh                # Build script — creates the .app bundle
  ranger.png              # Custom menu bar + app icon
  hollywood.mp4           # Your screensaver video(s)
  HollywoodSaver.app/     # Built app (generated by build.sh)
```

The entire app is a single Swift file compiled with `swiftc` — no Xcode project, no dependencies, no frameworks beyond what ships with macOS.

## Building

```bash
bash build.sh
```

This creates the `.app` bundle with Info.plist, compiles the Swift source, generates the app icon from `ranger.png`, and code-signs it ad-hoc.
